                Hello guys, my name is Ndaleh Nyhong. I am currently sixteen years old. <br>
                I am currently a frontend developer for web appplications who is looking <br>
                forward to full stack development. I am a student of BGS Molyko. I wrote <br>
                the GCE Ordinary Level Examination this year. I am a science student. 
            </p>

                <h2>Short Autobiography</h2>
                I was born on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August 2008. I obtained basic education <br>
                at Saint Theresa International Bilingual Nursery and Primary School. I later <br>
                on moved to Bilingual Grammar School Molyko Buea, which I am still in. <br>
                I have many hobbies and passions. Some of my hobbies include: playing football <br>
                and basketball. I just love to write code and understand how these fascinating <br>
                machines work and how they can be used to better our lives and express our <br>
                creativity.
