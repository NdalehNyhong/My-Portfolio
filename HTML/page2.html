            I was first exposed to programming three years ago. I first learned <br>
            Scratch, with which I built a simple game. <br>
            Later on I started diving deeper into programming and familiarizing <br>
            with concepts. A year later I learned Python and was able to build <br>
            simple console applications. The next year I dived deeper <br>
            into Python and learned some libaries like turtle graphics, the <br>
            random libary, and array libary. Currently I stand as a frontend <br>
            developer with a little knowledge on HTML and CSS.
